# 🧠 Object Recognition & Feature Detection using SIFT, RANSAC, and Harris

This project showcases image processing and computer vision techniques to detect and match features between images using SIFT, RANSAC, and Harris Corner Detection. It demonstrates how keypoint detection and robust matching can be applied for object recognition tasks.

## 🔧 Features Implemented

- **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform):**  
  Detects and describes local features in images, invariant to scale and rotation.

- **RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus):**  
  Filters outliers and estimates a robust homography between matched keypoints.

- **Harris Corner Detection:**  
  Identifies corner-like features in an image for basic feature extraction.

## 🖼️ Sample Workflow

1. Load input and reference images.
2. Detect keypoints using SIFT and Harris.
3. Match features across images.
4. Use RANSAC to compute a transformation matrix.
5. Visualize matched keypoints and object recognition results.
